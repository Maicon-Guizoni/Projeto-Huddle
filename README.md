## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I had some Flex improvement since last challange, and responsive improvement as well.
It was very hard work but i finished it! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
One and half day to finish this challange ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥±

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
}
```

### Continued development

I am a little more comfortable with "flexbox" property but i want to refine and perfect my knowledge.
